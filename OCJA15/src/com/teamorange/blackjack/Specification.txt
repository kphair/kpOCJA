You are required to write a Prototype command line program to play the card game Black Jack. The game will consist of 2 virtual players who will play 11 games against one another, the winner being the one who wins the most games.

Call your program: BlackJackApp
You will need to use, the Random class, enums, arrays, for loops, if statements.

After each game, the app should pause and prompt the user to hit the return key to continue with the next game

The program should be robust and recover from all reasonable exceptions and errors.

Note: There may be changes to requirements.

	initialise deck array
	shuffle deck array
	select dealer

	WHILE TRUE
	
		deal one card to player
		get total of player's cards
		if playerTotal > 21 then
			player loses
			break
		else if playerTotal == 21 
			player win
			break
		else if playerTotal > 16 then
			break
		end if
		
	END WHILE
			
	if player score < 21 deal one card to dealer
			
	WHILE TRUE
	
		deal one card to dealer
		
		get total of dealer's card
		if playerTotal > 21 then
			dealer loses
